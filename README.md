Asset-Discrepancy-NMSAI is a production-ready AI microservice for automated telecom asset detection from images. The service processes image input, performs object detection using a YOLO-based model, and returns structured detection results along with an annotated image.

This system is designed for controlled CPU environments and containerized deployments, with built-in safeguards to ensure stable operation under concurrent load.

---

## Overview

Asset-Discrepancy-NMSAI provides an HTTP API that:

1. Accepts an uploaded image (JPEG or PNG).
2. Decodes the image using OpenCV.
3. Performs thread-safe YOLO inference.
4. Detects telecom infrastructure assets.
5. Returns structured detection results.
6. Generates an annotated image with bounding boxes.
7. Returns the annotated image encoded as Base64.

The service is built with FastAPI and designed for scalable backend deployment.

## Key Features

- Production-grade FastAPI service
- Global YOLO model loading at startup
- Automatic model download from GitHub Release
- Thread-safe inference using locking mechanism
- Concurrent request control using semaphore
- Annotated image returned as Base64
- Color-coded bounding boxes for each asset class
- Dockerized deployment configuration
- Headless OpenCV optimized for server environments



## System Architecture

![System Architecture](documentation/asset-discrepancy-nmsai-system-architecture.png "Asset Discrepancy NMSAI")



## Model Distribution

The production model is distributed via GitHub Release.

Version: `v1.2.0`  
Model File: `asset-11l-cp03-180.pt`

The application automatically downloads the model at startup if it is not present locally.

---

## Configuration

Core configuration parameters are defined in the service code.

### Model Configuration

```python
MODEL_PATH = "asset-11l-cp03-180.pt"

MODEL_URL = "https://github.com/mirteldisa01/Asset-Discrepancy-NMSAI/releases/download/v1.2.0/asset-11l-cp03-180.pt"
```

### Concurrency Control

```python
model_lock = threading.Lock()
batch_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(10)
```

Concurrency behavior:

- A maximum of **10 concurrent requests** are allowed.
- YOLO inference is protected using a **global thread lock** to avoid race conditions.
- Additional requests wait in queue until a slot becomes available.

This design prevents CPU overload and ensures stable inference behavior.

## Supported Detection Classes

The service detects telecom infrastructure assets and normalizes class names using a mapping layer.

### Class Mapping

| Model Class    | API Output     |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| rru            | RRU            |
| panel_antenna  | Panel_Antenna  |
| microwave_dish | Microwave_Dish |

### Bounding Box Colors

| Class          | Color (BGR) |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Panel_Antenna  | Dark Red    |
| RRU            | Purple      |
| Microwave_Dish | Dark Green  |

Each detection is visualized with a colored bounding box and labeled confidence score.

### Response Example

```json
{
  "total_objects": 3,
  "counts": {
    "RRU": 1,
    "Panel_Antenna": 1,
    "Microwave_Dish": 1
  },
  "detections": [
    {
      "class": "RRU",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "bbox": [120, 85, 260, 310]
    },
    {
      "class": "Panel_Antenna",
      "confidence": 0.88,
      "bbox": [420, 90, 520, 350]
    }
  ],
  "image_base64": "..."
}
```

Response fields:

- `total_objects` — total number of detected assets
- `counts` — object counts per class
- `detections` — list of detection results
- `image_base64` — annotated image encoded in Base64

## Thread Safety Strategy

To ensure safe concurrent execution, the system enforces two mechanisms.

### 1. Concurrency Limiter

```python
batch_semaphore = threading.Semaphore(10)
```

Limits the system to **10 concurrent processing requests**.

### 2. Thread-Safe Model Inference

```python
model_lock = threading.Lock()
```

Ensures only **one inference operation** runs at a time to avoid race conditions inside the YOLO model.

This architecture prevents memory conflicts and improves stability under load.
